# supply-chain-management
*OVERVIEW

A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two
years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and
supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in
inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to
optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.
